The point of this exercise is for you to look at the results from the models and not to practice your coding, so I am providing all the necessary code for you. This also means that you are expected to discuss and type the answers to the questions. \n",

The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela.   The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and      historic medical records of 858 patients. Several patients      decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy  concerns (missing values).\n",
